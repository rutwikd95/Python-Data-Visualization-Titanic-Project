# Python-Data-Visualization-Titanic-Project
This is Data Visualization project for the Titanic Survivors Data Set done using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python.

Using the data set which was obtained from Kaggle's Dataset Repository ("train.csv") provided, we can visualize data using linear and factor plots to answer some questions like: 

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

5.) How does being with family and being alone affect the survival of the passenger?
